Databases are the standard way to use dynamic information in modern technology, making them an integral part of almost any application. The course pays serious attention to the relational model, modeling data with ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships) and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, connections, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Fundamental knowledge of working with ACID transactions and transaction processing, and practical tips for tuning performance are provided. This course lays the foundations for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understanding concepts such as turning a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).
